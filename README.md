CareerMate is a **Flutter-based AI-powered job and career platform** designed to support both **employers and job seekers** in one complete ecosystem.

This application aims to **simplify hiring, job searching, skill development, and interview preparation** using modern UI design and artificial intelligence.

### ⭐ Main Features Demonstrated in This Version
1. **Job Posting Management**
   - Post new jobs  
   - Edit job listings  
   - Delete job postings  
   - View current job list  

2. **Candidate Management**
   - View recommended applicants  
   - Filter candidates by role & location  
   - View detailed candidate profiles  
   - Shortlist or reject candidates  
   - Candidate status updates instantly  

These two functions were selected because they represent the **core employer workflow** and best demonstrate our system’s value and UI/UX design.
